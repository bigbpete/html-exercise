    <h3>Cities I have lived</h3>
        <p>In early years there was little choice in location (obviously).
        It was from Jacksonville forward where personal choices began. First a college degree and a commission in the Army follwed by work as a police officer in
        suburban Atlanta. Then came war in 2001; everything changed with my recall to active duty and 
        the miriad of locations the Army took me afterwards. Then illness struck and a medical retirment
        from the Army took me to St. Augustine, Florida. From there work sent me on new
        adventures with the US Forest Service, then the US Air Force as a civilian.</p>

    <h3>Cities I Would Like to Visit Someday</h3>
        <p>I think the term "bucket list" is over-used. These are just
            simply places I would like to journey to some fine day. A start 
            to an unknown adventure.
